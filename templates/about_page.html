                Divya loves to explore amazing restaurants and cafes. In her quest to find unique places, she reads through various blogs, food websites and articles. She heard about Sentiment Analysis with NLP when she was working in finance. It came naturally to her, to use NLP based VADER Sentiment Analysis library for analyzing huge amounts of text for her restaurant exploration. User Reviews data from websites (YELP, Google) wasn't freely available, hence the search options currently are limited. But, this WebApp gives an idea of how we can use NLP to grade businesses.

                SAFIYA is a restaurant search service WebApp that gives a sentiment score for restaurants. It uses NLP in backend to process reviews given by users and assigns a sentiment score to their review. Using this service, a user can skip the tedious traditional way of reading multiple reviews before selecting a restaurant. The service aggregates review data into a single scoring system and takes into account the "social media" lingo as well. The WebApp uses YELP API to get restaurant data and Google Maps API to give user the ability to locate a restaurant. It generates  Word cloud (D3.js),  for each restaurant to provide clear representation of user sentiments. User can also explore interactive mode of VADER score generation for their reviews.
