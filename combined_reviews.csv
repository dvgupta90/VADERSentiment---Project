UXNoTqkjA2zdXPftcqBvYQ,So good!  Had dinner here on a Friday night.
UXNoTqkjA2zdXPftcqBvYQ,"This place is fantastic.   Great food and wine list at a reasonable price.   If you like the Los Altos Grill, you will like this place.   Much easier to get in and much better food and wine pricing."
UXNoTqkjA2zdXPftcqBvYQ,I went to the Bistro because they play the World Cup on their screen. It is located inside the Courtyard Marriott so you can just park it (for free) at the hotel parking lot and walk in. I ordered the chicken pot pie. It took little less than 15 minutes to get my order. The chicken soup inside the pie was heavenly and it really goes well with the crust. I loved it!
UXNoTqkjA2zdXPftcqBvYQ,"I went here with friends during lunch time. The iced coffee was bomb. I got the burger and it was delicious. Service was great, very friendly waitress."
UXNoTqkjA2zdXPftcqBvYQ,"LOVE The Bistro! Drinks, meals, appetizers, and desserts were all so delicious! Service was fast & friendly, parking was free & plentiful, and the patio was a great spot to catch up with friends after work. The spot is a little hidden, as it's a part of the Marriott, so drive by slowly to avoid missing it. I heard there's live music Saturday nights, aka I'll be coming back soon. The Bistro is a great new find, enjoy!"
UXNoTqkjA2zdXPftcqBvYQ,"Great for the price! Despite being in the hotel, the space is very cool so definitely give it a try before dismissing it because of that. The burger I had was very well out together and not super sloppy. My friends pasta smelled delicious. Early supper menu from 5-630 is a great deal."
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,A sister restaurant to Bandera in Chicago with essentially the same menu. The macho salad is fantastic and the quality of the ingredients make up for the price ($23). Service is smooth and efficient.
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,I loved coming to this place but over this last weekend I found out they now charge 20 dollars for corkage fee. It used to be free. What happened??
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,"Quaint little spot right outside the main street of downtown Los Altos. We had reservations for 2 for 5pm on a Wednesday. Was quite lively! Under my reservation, I listed we were celebrating a birthday which the server acknowledged as we sat at our table. Service was attentive & helpful. Menu is competitively priced. Food we ordered was simple but satisfying."
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,"I've been coming to this wonderful restaurant since it used to be Banderas. The best food, the best atmosphere, and great service make this my go to place. They use real mesquite wood when they grilled or chicken. We had prime rib, the macho chopped salad with dates and avocado, a nice hamburger with Monterey cheese, And of course the wonderful fillet mignon. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Their bar opens at 4 o'clock and they have really good margaritas, Cosmo's, and martinis. A+ is you can bring one bottle of wine with no corkage fee. We always take it"
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,"One of my favorite restaurants in the South Bay (I know it's a chain, but it's the closest one to me). I've been going here for +20 years and the food has been consistently good throughout the years. The service here is generally good (some hostesses are a little curt but overall they are friendly and accommodating)."
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,"I use to really like this place and previously I would say the corn bread is a must but, the last few times I have been extremely disappointed with the service and food. I do not know if there is a new chef or what, but it's not the same. Brought a girlfriend here for her birthday and she was so excited to try this place and after the meal she mentioned ""I don't know what all the hype is about, the food was mediocre and the famous corn bread was cold and hard"". We mentioned to our server that the corn bread was cold and she brought us a new one that was supposedly fresh out of the oven, however the replacement also tasted hard and stale."
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,This place has destroyed 20+ years of good will. We won't be coming back nearly as often. So sad.
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,Great experience here last night.  It was busy and lively per usual.  I hadn't been here for several months after they stopped taking reservations and I had a couple of poor back to back experiences but they started taking reservations again and we were seated on time last night.
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,"Good service.  Short, but thorough menu, which I actually prefer, has a little bit of everything.  The food and drinks are made perfectly.  Been here a couple of times, looking forward to visiting again!"
_1yJBsOdhRtYHl0_QzFHug,"I love the food ,ambiance, service..I've met my friend there twice after work and the they have always been accommodating with excellent wine recommendations. ample pours and delicious sea food,and steaks.. Will be coming here again soon, i hope"
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"What prompted me to write is the quinoa bowl. I've had a variety of quinoa, spinach, and whatever gets thrown in with that type dishes around the world, this one is definitely top two. I loved the roast cauliflower, hearty mushroom pieces, and of course the grilled avocado. I was super happy with it."
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,This was the worse experience I have had at restaurant in recent memory. Almost everything was wrong. This will be long so if interested read on. 
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"This restaurant is more on the upscale side, the decor, the vibe, and the price. They do have a happy hour menu which makes it a lot more affordable, almost everything on the HH menu was under $10, it's in the bar area only so no reservation."
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"Time for Happy Hour with my coworkers! My manager left early to reserve us a table so we met up with her later. Parking not too bad on a Thursday, but an option to park in the garage is available. "
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"Now with the new management things got better. And we only hope it keeps the standards up for a long time. So far the food has a much better taste, it's not overly salty snd has flavor.  The presentation of the dishes has also improved. New servers seem to be more efficient and professional, other than sloppy, forgetful and getting our orders incorrectly. The manager came by to our table asked if everyrhing was ok, very thoughtful. Consistency is the key, keep it up."
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"We went in Friday night without reservation. We were seated quickly though the restaurant was jam packed. Seeing how busy they were, I was expecting slow service and probably would wait long time for the food."
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,Could not eek out more than three stars even with the $55 for two Monday night special which was a bottle of wine plus a starter and entree'.  
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"Paul Martins used to be a great neighborhood restaurant. Now they raised their prices and their portions are smaller. The food is still pretty good but not for those prices and portion. 2 fish tacos each with a small piece of fish, $21? Too pricey!"
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"Though the food was good, the service left me very disappointed. "
7TPhuOdvfEeavKmYSUVKFQ,"First time here with a small group of friends. The staff, host and waiter were very professional and very nice. We felt very welcomed. The ambience was really nice it was a bit on the darker side. There was plenty of room for seating. Very clean inside and in a nice part of town. Large parking garage close by."
pFhP33DZJRVyHevKDVke5Q,The folks who dine at La Comida really enjoy the friendly staff and excellent food. This is a wonderful resource for our community.
pFhP33DZJRVyHevKDVke5Q,"Seniors love La Comida!!! It's a great place to get a wonderful nutritious meal and meet other people. I was talking with a senior diner at La Comida the other day who said after her boyfriend died, she needed to find a place where she could make friends and meet other people her age. She said it's too hard to socialize with people in her apartment who are always on the go and don't have time to even say hi. La Comida serves a warm tasty meal 5 days a week and she's gotten to know some of the regulars she sees each time. I'm a volunteer there. La Comida is always looking for volunteers too."
pFhP33DZJRVyHevKDVke5Q,"La Comida provides quality, nutritious meals in an great environment for socializing. The friendly, volunteer and professional staff work hard to make a visit to La Comida a wonderful experience for our seniors."
pFhP33DZJRVyHevKDVke5Q,"A well-run organization mostly based on volunteers, La Comida is a great place for seniors to get a healthy meal and commune with friends. When you walk in, you are greeted and guided to an open table where you do not sit alone. They serve you a warm, delicious meal that is beautifully-presented and consists of a protein, usually a sauce, healthy vegetables, and a starch. You get your recommended daily allowance without feeling the food or service is institutional. The volunteers who serve the meal are trained to serve from the left and pick up from the right, so you feel like you're being cared for. It's a great deal at $3 (suggested donation), especially when all your friends are there. Definitely check it out."
pFhP33DZJRVyHevKDVke5Q,"It's hard for any food venue to please more than 50% of the people.  However, La Comida, at very low cost to seniors, serves nutritionally balanced meals that are frequently quite tasty.  Given their low budget, it's nearly a miracle that they do as well as they do and the staff is friendly and accommodating."
pFhP33DZJRVyHevKDVke5Q,"Many seniors depend on La Comida for a balanced daily meal and to socialize. The food is not salted and not spiced because of dietary restrictions of many seniors. The cost to seniors is $3, and for many who don't cook this place provides a great service. Sometimes there is entertainment, piano, voice, and recognition of special holidays. It's also convenient for seniors who take advantage of Avenidas senior center's excellent  programs, writing workshops, bridge, mah jong, language lessons and such."
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,"I've been here twice now, and so far so good! Both times I've gotten the same thing (I'm a boring/picky eater) - basically a customized version of the Cowboy burger, but with a turkey patty and minus the bacon. For a turkey patty it's very juicy, and that beer BBQ sauce is to DIE for! Seriously, I want a whole bottle if they sell it. The fries are also really good, service is friendly, and prices are reasonable for the area."
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,I liked the food and drinks here but the service is really terrible. Came here on Saturday early afternoon and the place was not crowded at all but the staff seemed very sloppy.
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,Eureka is one of my favorite places to eat and drink beer!
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,"The only downside is that the place is always packed and busy, so it's super important that you make reservations in advance. The atmosphere can get loud, but it's a great place to hang out and have dinner. My favorite is actually their veggie burger, and make sure to get either truffle fries or sweet potato fries with it! I really think Eureka has the best sweet potato fries. If you come during happy hour, you can also get food and appetizers at a discount. I highly recommend their fish tacos and nachos. I'll definitely be coming to Eureka often whenever I get the chance."
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,Great first time experience here which means we'll be returning the next time we're in the area.
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,"Meh. We ordered a burger, fish tacos, cauliflower appetizer, brussel sprouts and a few drinks. Everything was just okay. Normally I love brussel sprouts anywhere I go and I have to say I was underwhelmed and it was a very small portion. The cauliflower app was also lacking flavor. Not sure why this place has great reviews other than it is a very lively and loud atmosphere. "
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,This place is great for their creative take on burgers. There's a huge variety of beef burgers and non-beef options. 
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,Eureka is a nice place for happy hour. 
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,"Had a lovely dinner here today - something for everyone in our group from meat eaters to vegetarians. I enjoyed my watermelon salad and asked for falafel on top which was delicious and not at all dry. My fiancé has a nightshade intolerance and is generally very picky and our server, Joe, was extremely accommodating and attentive to his needs without making any unnecessary fuss. Joe was great overall service was on point. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area or cruising through mountain view on Caltrain. It was a little loud inside and there were some comments from my family about the meat being too well done so 4 stars not 5."
l8GVZvw9fFVGPupJg5DMKA,"There's clearly a lack of communication with the servers and chefs, and I got pretty sick from eating the burger, even after I thought I had scraped all the cheese off (I didn't want to be a burden and send it back). The server was understanding, but this is a serious risk for anyone who has a food allergy or avoidance. I love the atmosphere of the place and the burger itself and drinks were solid, but I just can't go back because this has happened multiple times :/"
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,"First of all of you haven't made a trip here yet, you are missing out. Byington offers some of the nicest wines around and all at a great price point. "
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,"This would be a great place to gather with a group of friends, have some light snacks while trying great wines, and enjoy your evening."
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,Maybe don't have a whisky guy with an attitude problem do wine tastings folks... just a suggestion.
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,"Awesome atmosphere and design, and great wines!   And delightful staff... Rose was wonderful!"
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,We had our book club meeting at the Los Altos Tasting room.  The venue was perfect we enjoyed the wine tasting and appetizers.  The room is elegantly outfitted with enough space to sit down for our group of 8 and also walk around and mingle.  We liked it so much we are coming back!!!  A great addition to Main Street.
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,"This is a great addition to downtown Los Altos. A perfect place to sit, drink wine and talk. We had great service. The wine was excellent, we bought two bottles. My only suggestion is to have some dimmer lighting."
6jLq8SLx-TqL3aP9-lRTAw,"Great wine at a great location in downtown Los altos. Clean, simple, and chill atmosphere to sample some wines and get the perfect appetizers. Highly recommend!!"
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,"I love, love, love, love this place. It is so peaceful and relaxing - it is like taking a little mini tropical vacation! The food is fabulous for breakfast lunch and dinner. A few things I highly recommend: berry crepes, French toast, berry smoothies, fried calamari, french fries, Dinah's Salad, cheesecake for dessert."
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,"Service was great too! Despite being outdoors, the heat lamps made the dining experience delightful!"
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,Excellent surprise. Good food and surprisingly clever. Unique selections and comfort food alike. Try the octopus! Wow! Great setting by the pool. This is especially nice at night with pool lit and some live music playing at a relaxed level. Classy but not at all pretentious. And the food quality to price ratio is tough to beat.
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,"All in all, not quite as good as I was hoping it'd be."
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,Great customer service from Melchor!
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,"Of course this is an upscale spot so everything was amazing. So you're sitting in front of a heated pool. The service is fantastic and The coffee was amazing, like what else can you ask for... I recommend breakfast time, it is peaceful and relaxing while you're having great food."
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,I like it here. Some of the food is great. Vegetarian burger in outstanding. The atmosphere is what really stands out. Good beverages too.
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg," mean it's a poolside restaurant...so seating was outside overlooking the hotel. Not a bad place though. We ordered the huevos rancheros, they have a different name on the menu but that's what it was, and they were bland and the presentation of the food itself was plain. Asked for over medium eggs but they were super runny and very lackluster. The pancake was awful. It had a weird taste and I'm not sure if it was the syrup or the batter but I mean how do you mess up pancakes? Overall, probably will never go back"
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,Good location and a decent veggie black bean burger. Service was average on a busy morning.
MyJXXDE1RKzmfg1h2W1-Dg,"I'm not a local, but I found this Poolside Restaurant on Google. I decided to give this place a try and I love it! The staff is friendly and the food is super good. I love the atmosphere in this restaurant. I definitely will come back again!"
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,Yum.  Former French laundry chefs serve delicious Californian French fare in a casual lounge area.  Shrimp chips with tartare were delicious as well as ham hush puppies and the ricotta ravioli had a mind blowing texture with plenty of parmesan umami.
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,People are very approachable and accommodating. This is the only restaurant that even if you walk-in they treat you like no others. I am definitely and recommending this restaurant to all my colleagues. 
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,"A very special restaurant! They have two different sides. A more formal side with a set menu and price ( some choice is still available) and an a la carte side where you can watch the open kitchen, there is a swanky bar and an outside patio with limited seating. The owners have a reputation before this new start up as renown chef and sommelier and it showed with wine list, sommelier apprentice and tender care and special touches to each dish! "
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,"We booked at Protege after seeing the high Yelp reviews.  Halfway through the meal, it was clear that the food was worthy of a Michelin rating.  We spoke with the owner and he met his head chef/partner at French Laundry.  The head chef worked at 2 other 3-star Michelin restaurants including El Bulli.  "
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,Sat on the more informal side and felt comfortable and well taken care of. The short ribs were DELICIOUS and accurately described by our waiter. The dessert cart is fun.
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,"Interesting new concept in Palo Alto with a dining room and lounge. Very hyped up opening with chefs from French Laundry and the floor manager from Manresa. I was only able to eat at the bar and I was personally a little bit disappointed with the options I had tried. I had the ricotta dumplings that just didn't work for me, and the spanish octopus which I think was not seasoned/flavored well.  Prices have gone from reasonable for the dining room at 85 to 120 in just a couple of months which I personally think is bad business. "
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,We were looking forward to a new dining experience in Palo Alto. After reading the highly hyped reviews of Protégé we thought we love to try it. We thought the food was mediocre at best and the food was bland. My husband ordered the short rib which was tasteless. I ordered the brick chicken which was sitting on a bed of dried out rice (too long under the heat lamp?)
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,"she tried her best, to which I have to strongly disagree. My opinion is she completely forgot we were there. The owner made no attempt at all to turn this situation around. Being in the service industry myself I could think of five ways off the top of my head that this situation could have easily been turned around. I left the restaurant in tears, this was a dinner my husband had planned to celebrate my 50th birthday and our wedding anniversary and it was completely ruined."
sW_zH7aCKlUU9Pf4_XYViQ,"I had been looking forward to the meal due to all the hype. It was hard to make a reservation for the prix fixe in the dining room. In short, the food was fine but not so good to be unforgettable. The service was disappointing. The decor/ambience was OK."
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"Come for the fun vibe, light bites and enjoy.  It is entertaining.  But save your appetite for a full 4-5 star restaurant."
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"I just love when you don't expect anything special to happen when you go to a new restaurant, and then you end up having fantastic service and a great time!"
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"Really perfect little spot in downtown Los Altos. Amazing menu, fantastic service and a really great ambiance. Both indoor and outdoor seating on a nice California day. Really enjoyed this place."
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"Nice place, I like the open kitchen concept. ASA main dinning room offers a full view of the kitchen through clear glass. This is nice because, you don't leave the restaurant smelling like food. Also, cute shaded outdoor seatings. Good cocktails. Minus 1 star for the slow service. My girl friend and I waited quite some time to get our second round of drinks {restaurant became busier} and when it finally arrived, we were told by the person who finally brought out our drinks that our server was socializing with other customers and apologize for the delay; tsk tsk tsk, cold cocktails no longer taste good if it's room temp. All in all, a must try."
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"It was far beyond my expectation, both food quality and service. "
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,Things from start to finish were perfect!!!
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"It may be Los Altos prices, but the quality is excellent, and actually reasonable considering what you get (for the entrees, anyway)."
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"LOVED my dinner at ASA!!! We came here to celebrate my birthday and they did not disappoint.  We brought in our own wine and the corkage was fairly reasonable for a nice restaurant.  The food was spectacular.  I wasn't really sure what the cuisine to was when I had looked up the menu in advance, but it's really a variety of Italian, Spanish and American dishes that are done tapas style (for the most part).  Everything was delicious, so I don't think you can really to wrong food-wise.  "
8C_B-4cRVVUXHAEgQv1rCg,"Our party of 11 chose this restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Friday night. The first thing that comes to mind is that service was SUPER slow, but friendly. After ordering drinks and apps, the champagne arrived quickly, but the food did not. I do not like to drink without food. While waiting, a friend and I went outside to visit diners with a chocolate lab because we were waiting THAT long. "
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"Only open a few days you'd never know. But with the pedigree of the chef, expectancy is high. Still they delivered. Veggies, pastas, cured meats, dessert..all on point. The food however is still very accessible considering where the pedigree comes from. The space is very nicely remodeled-though still carries much of LB Steaks old floor plan. With the patio area and lunch coming down the line it will make for great alfresco lounging. Menlo Park is slow to change and it really needed Campers modern sensibility-to give the town a jolt."
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"Camper is a breath of life in a sleepy downtown. The new renovation brings a warm but stylish ambience that really works. But you're mostly here for the food, which is where it really shines."
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"Had dinner at Camper tonight.  I would not recommend this restaurant for the food or ambiance.  Bottom line: The menu looks interesting but it's clearly overly ambitious for the kitchen staff.  The kitchen doesn't know what the food is supposed to taste like, so anything is ok.  "
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"This is a new addition to Menlo Park that was sorely needed. The food was excellent! We shared the burrata salad, then ordered one pasta, one chicken as a main entree, dessert, a cocktail and a glass of wine. The total bill? Less than $100! What else did I love? The freshness and quality of the produce, the ""cleanliness"" of the food, not overly oily, heavily sauced or sweet. The roast chicken was really moist!"
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"Overall, we had a fabulous experience at Camper. We didn't feel it was particularly noisy, but we also arrived on the early side. Frankly, I'd brave any noise level to have that rigatoni again. We're going to try to walk in this weekend (wish us luck!)"
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"Overall, good place to go for a nice dinner. You can tell the owners put their hearts into the business. Brings great vibes to the DT Menlo Park scene, and we need more businesses like this. I hope that the salting techniques and staff will improve their technique and hospitality respectively."
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,One of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. Beet salad with watercress was delightful along with some of the best deviled eggs I've ever had. Homemade pasta was cooked to perfection. My daughter gobbled up her short-rib. As if that wasn't enough dessert was over the top delicious.
0k58IxlG1h3FYJN_T9mLGw,"I decided to give this new restaurant a try but was rather disappointed with my meal. The rigatoni was okay but the Harvest salad was very bland. Above all, the noise level is horrible!  A real deal breaker."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,One of the best places for parantha. Heavenly north indian parantha. We ordered aaloo and paneer parantha along with chole bhature. The food is really good!
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Pretty neat and tidy Indian joint with good food. The only reason I didn't give a full 5 was because they were taking too long to deliver our food. (And no, it was not at all busy then. We were the only two people). The menu is a typical south Indian place menu and add to it the parathas and chola bhatura. The chhole didn't impress me much but their puri and bhaaji was really good. Ghee dosa was another good find but it had cooled down bu the time they got it to the table. Dipped wada and sambhar were the best pick. Got two medu wadas dipped in a super thick sambhar with a coconut chutney. Alos I wish they weren't so stingy with their chutneys. Got a tiny bit of each with the dosa. Overall, great tasting food. Tiny place so might be a wait if you are a huge group."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Wow this place is chaotic as hell. Looks like a family run shop that is totally disorganized. I had to wait over 45mins for the dosa and turns out they messed up the order and gave the dosa someone else. As far as the food is concerned, the sambhar was the best part of the meal. The dosa was super bland and the chutneys were cold. I don't understand why you would serve cold chutney with hot dosa. "
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"So good, really like this place great food super, super fresh and great prices. Good portions. Wish the water was a little more fresh maybe some ice cubes, but everything else is on point. Not a fancy place but really good food."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"They serve exactly what it's in their name, usual South Indian fare - Dosas, Vada, Idli, Utapams. Sambhar was much better than Madras Cafe and the Chutneys with the dosas were tasty and fresh. And the North Indian as well, mostly parthas served with pickle, butter, yoghurt were delicious . And prices are really competitive. Great first visit, will be back for more."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,Absolutely Fantastic place! Had an onion rava dosa with paneer and a podi with some excellent coffee! Very nice owner and place too :) must go!
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Vegetarian restaurant. Primarily, South Indian food but they do have some North Indian options as well. Extremely competitive in terms of the prices."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"I ordered the mooli paratha, spicy and it was great! It comes with cubed butter, small side of raita & achaar(pickled veggies). It was so fresh! The service is very friendly. They're primarily known for their dosas, so I'll have to try those soon. Great prices for the quantity of food you get here!!"
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Good parathas, amazing buttermilk but extremely slow service, despite being a small place. Apart from the service aspect, good low cost and low frills place."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,Excellent food!! Good service. Sambar is very tasty. Chole Bhature are good too. Will definitely come back 
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"A new addition, this is the finest Indian restaurant in the South Bay bar none. One of the very few Indian restaurants in the US where you get value for money. I hope it stays that way."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Very slow service. Waited for half an hour to get the dosa. You pay the tip before you pay, which is unfortunate."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Excellent food and amazing prices! Their dosas are very thin and crisp, and their vadas are flavorful. If you haven't had badam milk and are a fan of almond milk, I highly recommend it. It's goes great with spicy dishes."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Good place to have breakfast items. May be upma will be good to have in morning. Tried upma in the evening, didn't feel as expected."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"This place is super close to my work. I just visited for the first time. Located in a parking lot that includes a subway and a taco place, it is a tiny place with 6 tables. The host/owner was friendly. I ordered the mysore masala dosa and chai. Dosa was pretty good and so was the chai."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"I love these little South Indian restaurants in the Sunnyvale area. Had to wait an hour before I received my food. But that is the normal wait time on weekends, when there is a long line outside the restaurant."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Excellent food and service. Freshly made food. Both parathas and south Indian dishes had a great authentic taste, fresh chutneys and piping hot sambar were on point"
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"Never tasted this fresh cooked food coming right out of kitchen, piping hot and so flavorful ever, at any south or north Indian joints! I tried Mysore Masala Dosa, & Salty Buttermilk. Both were full of authentic flavors, the buttermilk with a ""Tadka"" tasted amazing! Very competitive pricing too, with a great service - wish they would open for breakfast too, I would love to have the right start to my day."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,"While the food quality is barely acceptable, service is absolutely atrocious. Items from order were missed. Rasam was not edible and not authentic. All in all avoid."
bmxi_Ts834MeAXa9_ysiVg,Felt like landed in Chennai for a dinner !!! Perfect place for South Indian Tiffin  should try North Indian recipe next time
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"This was my first time at the Palo Alto location and the overall look/feel of the place is so different from the Mountain View one. This is much more modern, lots of indoor and outdoor seating (with light outside) and a much larger counter space. Overall, I think a better spot. This is a great location. There is only street parking (I didn't have any issues finding a spot) and close to Caltrain. Food and service was still the same  - great! Service was super quick as well. We came on a Tuesday night at 730pm and there was no line. Food came out in less than 10 minutes. I love the paneer tikka wrap and their somosas. So good!"
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"First, they don't let you customize the food one bit. I like spicy food and requested them to make it spicy, they refused... you get whatever they serve. Second, I noticed that they are super stingy with the green or tamarind chutney for to-go orders. They used to have a chutney stand for self serve but noticed they removed it recently. So make sure you order extra chutney with your food. Third, don't come here during peak lunch hour or dinner times, the lines can be excruciatingly long and don't move fast."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"The later foods I have tried are more of a 3-3.5 star. So I have tried the Silver Spoon and Naan Wrap, both vegetarian versions, and I have to say that along with the fries, they all taste more on the dryer side. I think next time I would definitely try to balance out my dishes to get some more saucy ones, but especially eating the Aloo Samosa Naan Wrap in one meal was way too dry for me. The Silver Spoon (Paneer) tastes really good, but it was a bit too small and felt more like an appetizer :( "
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"This place is worth the hype. First off, unlimited chai!!! They do make a point to limit yourself to three cups, but that's a free drink right there! At this location, you do order first and then get a number to go sit at a table, but you should try to flag down one of the waiters and get them to save you a table after you get your number."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Been to Zareen's a couple times before, and was a little disappointed in the past but really enjoyed my meal today. I got the shami bun kabab which is a common Pakistani street snack - minced beef patties topped with an egg and served with sweet and spicy chutneys. Zareen's definitely hit it out of the park with this one. Tasted like the bun kabab was fresh off a street cart. Wish I lived closer to come here more often just for this. My husband got the chicken tandoori wrap which was also on point with flavors. Can't wait til my next trip."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Long lines are the only reason I would have dropped it down to 4 stars but it's not their fault they have great food. I only had the Kabob, which was magnificent - excellent option if you're on a low carb diet by the way. The meal came sizzling on a little cast iron skillet, which was awesome because I threw some jalapeños on there that fried a little bit and was the perfect complement. Everyone else on our table loved their meals but they were also regulars so didn't expect complaints. The sheermal was lovely though a bit on the sweet side. I would stick to naan personally but that's not really a negative, it's just a testament to how strongly I like naan. Free tea is nice and people loved it. All in all, worth going and it has a nice outdoor seating area too as a bonus."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"I always order the Chicken Tikka Masala meal and it is always delicious. The Naan and samosas here are also especially good. Don't forget to order a mango lassi too! Not to mention they have free chai tea which is very warm and comforting. The only downside is that this place is so popular that the line can be long sometimes, so best to go a little bit before 6pm so you don't have to wait in line."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"This is my first time eating at Zareen's. I pass by this place probably every week and I always see a long line inside that reaches out the door. I was so interested on how good it was since, me and my boyfriend love Indian/Pakistan food. Came here today and did NOT regret it. It was awesome!! Now this is our new favorite place for sure."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Amazing place man! I don't know why it needs a review but here I go. The ambience is decent, it's not a fancy place so if you are looking for that then this is not your place but it's decent, clean and the food is amazing. "
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"I like that you find a seat after you order/pay. This place gets super crowded at 7:30pm. Line is way out the door. The food is packed with flavor, but pretty spicy for me. It's a little pricey but not too bad. Portions are good. They have some pretty fun/unique decorations around their walls too."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Love this place. Must try - Silver Spoon Wraps, Fries and Firni"
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Probably a popular place for people but for me the food didn't cut it. I had paneer and chicken tikka meal with stale salad and few pieces Of salad leaves(really, why bother??). It was bland and barely warm. Not worth the wait and price at all.  The plate looks good, that's all. Much better Indian Pakistani restaurants out there."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Overall, the service was fast, I received my food in less then 15 minutes. The employees were kind and very efficient on removing plates from the table. I'm not sure if I will come back, but if I do I would wait a little longer to get hot food. 1 Star is for service 2nd star was for employees, my table was dirty and my food was salty and cold and that is why the stars stopped there."
3b0yY-kCOG-1Eq9oamlSzw,"Zareen's is doing a good job, and I can't complain about having a halal restaurant with two locations in the area. However...the burgers at Zareen's tends to be a bit on the dry side. I've had the Punjabi Chicken Burger and the Tandoori Chicken Burger, which would have been a lot better with some sauce. That's why I decided to get an order of the tikka masala sauce that usually comes with the wrap, and it was ultimately a great decision because the sauce went well with not only the burger but the masala fries as well. I also ordered a mango lassi, but there was no indication that I was supposed to pick it out instead of them placing it on the counter for me. Since most of the prepared lassi is behind the glass and next to the cash wrap, it wasn't clear if it was fine to just reach into their space. I had to run back and get my drink when I realized they weren't going to hand it to me."
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ,Zareen's has been my best find for Indian food that is not the kind that leads you towards a food coma! Seating can be a long wait if you decide to come late in the evening. A small wait will be worth it for sure. I absolutely love their meal platters and the naans are the best in south bay!
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ,Hard to review. The food was really good but the charge was not so good. The dish was small. Environment was not so clean… These things are all about expectations. I bumped into bad surprises. If that wasn't the case it would be a great experience....
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ,"We went here again for lunch and this time we got the entrees. While the portions for the appetizers are somewhat small, the portions for the entrees are much larger. In all, we really enjoyed the food as everything is flavorful and cooked well. "
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ,"My previous review still stands true. One of the best places for Pakistani/North Indian food. My very picky friend said the Punjabi Chicken Burger is THE best chicken burger he's ever had. Oh and I still haven't tried the Halwa Puri, which I'm hoping to try soon."
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ,"Pros: Delicious, affordable food. Soooooo so good! Cons: Seating... there's hardly any :("
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ," can't wait to go back here and eat more! Alas, we didn't eat a TON so it's hard to know for sure, but def 10/10 will be back to eat like everything else on the menu. I got a paratha wrap and it was stunning. Whatever they have written on their wall menu that sounds hyperbolic isn't. I think my boyf had a smaller version of the boti chicken meal -- it didn't come with that much food but neither of us were terribly hungry so it was just right."
ud9ocsQHI7h3zNO7FdOFYQ,"This place is sooo good and it has a constant stream of customers to prove it.  Their chicken is so unbelievably good.  Normally, when I think of chicken, I think of bland, dry meat, but their chicken is flavorful and tender."
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,"This place was outstanding. I have eaten my share of Indian food and I was thrilled by the quality, the value and the service at this place."
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,"Dismal service, below average Indian food & a problematic owner. If you are craving Indian food I would avoid this place like the plague. "
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,Hate it worst feeling ever. Wanted to give zero starts. Went there right now they just told sorry we are closing so only to go orders. Bulshit. Shut down business please if you dont wanna take customers. This means if we are eating and its 10:00 pm then just leave because they are closing.
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,"All in all it's an okay place to try! Not great, not bad!"
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,Excellent lunch buffet! The chicken tikka masala was great! Restaurant staff was friendly and accommodating.  Only had to wait 10 minutes during lunch rush. Will go back again when in town.
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,"Prices are probably one of the highest for Indian restaurant. Biggest issue I have with this place is how spicy food is. I love spicy food, but most Of the dishes are overly spiced and loses the taste."
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,This is where you come for burnt Naans. When you tell your server the Naan is burnt he argues and tells you affirmatively that it's not..look at the picture and decide for yourselves
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,Ordered Pakoras today from Darbar on doordash. There were 3 pakoras and then the person frying them got lazy and stuck me with two huge dal vadas. Not what I had asked or paid for. Such laziness is not expected from a fine dining restaurant.
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,"I had a very bad experience at Darbar recently. I arrived at the restaurant, the host asked me to take a seat. The business manager didnt see it and came and very rudely told me that I should be waiting at the door for the host. He even took me by the hand which really surprised me. Of course, I left the place right away. But this was a clear case where the owner acted in a very racist way towards me. I am very well off, I am just not white, and the owner felt he could take that kind of liberty with me. I will never be visiting that place again, even though the food was great sometimes, though not consistently."
lvYq2gLqYGQIEoWQ9E5H3w,"The food here was completely subpar. The reviews seem to be great, however as an East Indian, I would never recommend this place. Many other choices in Palo Alto. Don't waste your palette."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"Super yum! Authentically South Indian. A nice variety and if you order the thali lunch, you get free refills on the items."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"Yes, you took the right decision in choosing this food shop. It's great. "
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"Very good! After getting stranded in Mountain View when ozzy cancelled his concert, we decided to give this a try."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"Went here one of the saturdays for lunch - just before noon and were lucky to get seated quickly in this literally hole in the wall place. The staff was friendly and he food was just freshly made. Even the yogurt drink (lassi) was nice and spicy and freshly made. Loved their veg thali served on plantain leaf, the spices tasted uniquely fresh Chettinad style flavors. Reminded of the unlimited rice and food back in India, where they serve hot rice as you request. Appeared conscious about wastage of food unless you really asked for additional servings. Other food tasted included Prawn masala (which I heard was mind blowing). Will come back again for trying out other dishes."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"Awesome to find a banana leaf joint in the Bay Area. Very casual and prices are good so those are additional pluses. Parking is easy in the lot, and I'm the summer the outdoor seating is a nice option."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"Food is served on a banana leaf and you get the feeling of eating in an authentic south restaurants. We ordered the thali which comes with three curries, two veggies , dessert, rice and roti."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,The restaurant is big inside and lots of people working! I just ask for extra chutney and I got it in 2mins! I went on Sat lunch and there are quite a lot of people but it is not full.
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"New Indian restaurant in MV that serves homestyle south indian food the traditional way, on a banana leaf. We got the veg and non-veg thali which have unlimited refills for the curries, it's a good deal for ~$14. I am not really a rice person, they agreed to swap out the rice for chapati on request. The food is flavor packed, I especially liked their okra and black eyed pea sides. I was eager to try the poondu kolumbu, it didn't quite match expectations."
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,The service is terrible . Took over an hour to get food . Noone came and said anything . At that point I didn't care really how the food was. Really the worst service I have ever seen. 2 people serving over 50 patrons. 
QaxHp_LOZwwU_VZAdzF3OQ,"I came here twice and had to leave because of the wait time. Made me really want to eat and finally go a chance. As with most times when your expectations are very high, it does not quite match up to it."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,The appetizers are amazing. Main course was good in taste but the food was not warm enough to savour. The naans were too dry and there was no butter on them. Well no comments on that one. Desserts were borderline okay.
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,Wonderful place.
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"If you like Indian food you will LOVE this place. The food is awesome! Variety, lots of flavor, and...wait for it....it's a buffet all you can eat. The atmosphere is very welcoming and cozy even though it seems high end the staff are al friendly."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"Overall the meal was heavy, and we were satisfied. It was good good, but nothing too special"
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"This used to be my favorite North Indian restaurant for years. The MV/Los Altos branch was the best IMO. Not anymore. I gave it 3 chances in the last few months. The signature butter chicken completely let me down each time. The Sunday buffet quality is down as well. I loved this place for being authentic and at the same time innovative, not any more. They need to get their act together. Its sad when a quality place cannot maintain their standards."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"Terrible customer service! What has happened to them? They used to be very good. We went for lunch, and the servers we totally disinterested, not to mention badly turned out. They had an attitude, did not clear the plates from our table. They just kept piling up! The restaurant wasn't very crowded at this time either. The food quality has degraded as well. We had a very bad experience today. Will not be going back - Ever! Save your time and Money. Don't go to this Amber location."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"Way overpriced. I ordered butter chicken from this restaurant (through Uber eats) and I ended up paying $30 for one bowl of butter chicken. It doesn't say in the menu that it doesn't come with rice or bread or anything! Seriously? Other restaurants have the same food for $8. The quality of the food is not impressing either. If you are over charging, atleast have the decency and send some breads or utensils with it."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"We had big expectations from this place, mostly because of the overpriced menu. And we were hugely disappointed by both the food and the service. We ended up eating only half of what we ordered. Chicken Biryani was terrible, huge peices of chicken with very little rice and wasn't tasty at all. Only spice we could taste was red chillies. Do not reccomend it at all. And they have the audacity to add 4% surcharge on top of what is already an overpriced menu."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"However, it is very expensive. I paid $22 for the buffet including taxes and tips. That is ridiculous even for bay area prices. I wouldn't return even though I haven't enjoyed an Indian lunch buffet more at another restaurant."
S_PEOhwazfhpeEEPoTyyZg,"The food tends to be very, very creamy and heavy and doesn't taste light or fresh or freshly made. I'll likely not go back."
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,So overall ok - nothing to go crazy about :/
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,"Heard and read great reviews about this place, but was disappointed when we visited the place. Had called previous night to make reservations, and when we reached was made to wait for 30mins. The reason stated we don't see any such reservation on your name. Then we were being given a table for 4 and they were trying to accommodate 7 members!! We were wondering how we were going to sit in that small space. Thankfully another table got empty in the next few minutes and they joined it! And there is a way customers need to be spoken to. Even if there is a problem it needs to be sorted out with a smile on the face. Agreed that it was a peak Sunday lunch time, but that's when the hospitality should be at its best. Another thing was there is hardly any space to move about! Since its in downtown, its a pretty small restaurant. Too many tables placed in a small place. It was uncomfortable to move around and very congested. With all that, the food was good! Just needs improvement in the hospitality department."
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,"As Indian Buffets go, I really love this one. First, they have a clean restaurant with tons of wait staff to help you. They also have, more importantly, a huge selection of foods on their buffet. And finally, they are packed, so you get the feeling that the food is fresh as they go through it so quickly."
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,"I had a great time here and so happy to have discovered this delightful little gem.  The lamb was a little tough, but the okra dish will make your mouth water!"
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,"I came here hoping to have a great experience, especially since this is a newer restaurant.  I love indian food, and what could be better but undian buffet?  I have to say I am comparing this place to 3 other buffet places I have been to and unfortunately this was the worst one.  I came in and waited to be seated . As soon as he showed me my table, that was pretty much the end iof good service right there.  No one asked me or told me if I could get up to get my food, or where the plates where, or when the bread was coming.  They did however offer me a free fountain drink.  That was it.  "
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,Got the vegetable biryanis and it came with a naan bakes on top of it like a chicken pot pie. Very interesting! The flavors were good and the service superb
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,Amazing place !!! Super nice. Food was super tasty You should get the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. Location was good as well.
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,"Ordered a Vegetarian Dum Biryani for lunch. The order was part of a larger take-out and EVERYONE was disappointed with the food. For $14.99 one would expect something good, but no way. The rice was undercooked (not el-dente but raw), no flavors and tasted worse than any rice preparation I have had, leave alone a similar biryani! Not seen too many places charge steep prices like this and not serve raita with the biryani. The $4 raita was a total waste of money as the yogurt was slimy and had zero taste. Just like neighbor Shiva's, the fate of this place looks similar."
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,My favorite Indian restaurant in Mountain View. The service is good and I never have to wait for a small table. All 3 of the vegetaritan dishes that I have tried have been flavorful and almost spicy enough for my taste.
nriv3Qf50wJtPTot_WNYhQ,"This review is solely based on delivery for a Biryani. As a biryani fan, I want to review even though I can't comment on service and ambiance. The biryani came with boondi raita and Salan. Decently good biryani. Rice , raita and salan were 4 star. Chicken felt a bit old and not so soft. Overall I had wanted to give this place a 3.5 star. "
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,"The Bottom Line: Great service, great food, and an interesting atmosphere, and you'll definitely pay for quality."
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,"WORST experience for the money. Was there to celebrate , totally ruined the experience by service and cold food and had to pay 80$ with no alcohol in it btw."
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,"Overhyped. With so many other Indian buffets on Castro, Sakoon ain't even close playing with the big boys :/"
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,Overpriced Indian restaurant. The service was really cold. The woman at the front was really grumpy to find me a table even though they were 30 min away from their kitchen closing. 
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,"Never going again,even with reservation u still wait. The management has no coordination or communication. The floor is messy and couch is dirty with food stains . "
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,"Never going again,even with reservation u still wait. The management has no coordination or communication. The floor is messy and couch is dirty with food stains . "
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,"If the service wasn't so unforgivably terrible, I'd probably come back."
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,service is very very slow and customer service very poor. They charge average $15 and up for each entree still provide crappy service. I don't care about the taste if every time I go the experience is bad. Not going to visit again that is for sure.
VkR8UKEuUNnERao2NDYyJg,FRAUD ALERT! Always long waiting queue. Promises to provide table in 5 minutes but it will easily take more than an hour to get the table. Served unclean plates initially. Food quality is average.
#NAME?,This is our regular weekday Indian lunch spot. They have a wide selection of items including a vast number of vegetarian-friendly options.
#NAME?,"Very average tasting indian buffet place, or at least on a Monday for lunch, especially for vegetarians. They definitely had a huge variety of options, which was what I came for and brought my colleagues for. "
#NAME?,Typical Indian all you can eat buffet. Like that they have quite a spread for the starters arranged on street style food carts. Quite some options in curries and rices. Some good desserts and mango ice cream to finish. Their butter chicken is my favorite so far.
#NAME?,"Thought of giving it a try after reading multiple good reviews and I am so DISAPPOINTED! The food is edible but unsavory! No taste, the servers are disinterested, nothing to drink in the buffet menu. Veg pakoras were undercooked, the other things looked like leftovers from lunch menu. And one thing I definitely know being a punjabi is that whatever I ate named ""dal makhni"" was no way dal makhni! And if you love paneer dishes, you will be majorly missing it here! SKIP this one! Many other good Indian restaurant options available. Dont waste money on this one, considering it is 17$/person+tax!"
#NAME?,The staff was very friendly but to be honest the food was not really good I didn't really enjoy it the only thing that was good was the roti
#NAME?,"I've been going to Passage to India for over 25+ years. The point is I know it very well. Over the years it's been my go to consistent Indian restaurant. Lately, meaning the last few years, the quality of service has steadily gone down."
#NAME?,"I know...a lot of back-and-forth reviews here. We really do love this restaurant, but want it to have more consistency in its buffet dishes (bearing in mind that some of the fun of a buffet is having new things to try). BUT, we are definitely disappointed when we drive down to the peninsula and our favorite dishes are not out. What happened to the sweet-and-sour gobi, the usual 1 or 2 paneer dishes, and the chicken rolls? From what we see when they have these, they are very popular and fly off the table, so why not have them consistently? There are still MANY good dishes (pakora, masala dosa, and various curries) and Passage to India far outranks most Indian restaurants, especially other buffets. They have a HUGE variety, making it a great value. We will continue to visit, but hope to have even more reasons to!"
,
#NAME?,"We tried the weekend dinner buffet and sadly we were not impressed. The food was cold and looked and tasted stale. The chaat corner looked so non palatable. The pav bhaji and masala dosa were tasteless. Saag aalu, malai kofta, veg manchurian, veg noodles, tandoori chicken, veg and chicken biryani were decent and fish pakora, goat curry and gulab jamun were good. The pastry was dry and stale. The rice particles on the biryanis had dried up. The ambience and service were good. We will not be returning."
#NAME?,"Good selection, clean, really nice for 17.00 for.buffet. i ordered sea bass and fried shrimp off their menu and mango chutney. Service was very attentive and i Love their private parking lot. Everything went well."
#NAME?,I really liked this place! The food and the service is delicious! They have a big variety and each single thing tastes really good.
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"Its a mere coincidence that i had been to this Restaurant in SF, but didn't make a note of this..Found this one again & well, it was good as expected! De-constructed Samosa is having that amazing indian street food type of feel! Must try! Kaathi roll was just okay, have had it better."
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"My fiancé and I really enjoyed this place. The vibe is awesome, the food delicious and authentic, and the prices appropriate."
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"This the best Indian restaurant and Indian food I have ever had. It is also like the third Indian restaurant I've ever been to, but it has changed my opinion of Indian food. It's not just good among Indian food for me; it is good objectively. However, I don't remember the name of the food I had at all. Someone took me here and took care of the ordering."
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,Good food! Flavors are good and the portion size is also filling! This is not fine dine  so i don't expect them to have authentic flavors but they did decent close job being quick bite place. 
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"wo words: deconstructed samosa. By far the best thing I've had from Curry Up Now's menu, and this is the one I come back for over and over again! It's nothing more than a simple portion of stewed chickpeas, potato-filled samosas (both a big one a couple tiny crispy ones), and a whole shebang of herb chutneys and tamarind sauce, all topped with pico de gallo (of all things!). It's sweet, sour, spicy, savory, crispy, and creamy--the level of contrast in this dish is simply unparalleled! You can add a protein onto the plate as well, and on my most recent visit, I had the ""free range protein,"" which were basically nuggets of plant-based chicken. Come for this dish if you're a spice lover, and you won't be disappointed!"
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,Naughty Naan is basically naan pizza. They allowed me to order it with butter chicken which was not spicy. Served with a side salad with a wonderdul dressing. Ordered a Mango Lassi to drink and it had just the right consistency and sweetness. Delish!
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"Food on the other hand.... meh. The burritos are filled with just rice and only some curry then wrapped with a tortilla. Not cheap either. A lot of vegetarian options, but if you're looking for great and cheap Indian food here's not the place. My coworkers seemed to enjoy the plates, so that may be worth it over the burrito."
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"Please don't judge Indian food based on this chain of restaurants. The food here is nothing like the real deal. For instance, the deconstructed samosa is a poor version of ""samosa chaat"". In curry up now's version a number of tiny samosas are tossed and made completely soggy in a mess of random Indian food dumped together. It looks similar to what I used to give my dog sometimes. The real samosa chaat is basically one large crispy samosa, opened up and topped with yellow peas curry, tamarind sauce and finely chopped onion."
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"The only thing I get here is the pani purri. Every time I have a pani purri craving, this is the spot. I LOVE that they sprinkle the purris with a little bit of chili powder, gives it just the right amount of kick! The pani is delicious and the chaat filling is delicious. Their servings are sadly very, very small. "
0Vue5gS-KWjxCN7BHr8JeQ,"Lively, upbeat environment. Staff members are energetic and happy to help. They have so many choices so when I couldn't decide what I wanted, Sophie was happy to answer my questions."
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"This place is great. There are many options for lunch, and the food is really delicious. I go here around 3 times a week for lunch, and almost never had a bad experience. The staff is also great, they work great together and they are very friendly."
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"Consistently good food. Great option for lunch. Ingredients are extremely fresh and the food really does taste good! They have a range of different stations (grill, Indian, Mexican, make your own salad bar, 3 types of soups with chili being the constant while the 2 other options are different everyday). Apart from these there is a stir fry station...which serves different things everyday, another station that serves an eclectic range of dishes, then there's the flatbread station and of course there's a station for making your own sandwiches with a panini press. Lastly, they also have pretty good desserts. My lunch cost varies a lot...from $2-11 a day. I eat at Tibco everyday (Mon-Fri) and spend about $150 per month. Very affordable considering the fact that it is located in Palo Alto."
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"Even if my own office had a cafeteria I would still probably go to TIBCO. 1) because I need to walk and move around a bit bit more importantly 2) because the food is consistently good and 3) there are options galore. Seriously, you can have Mexican food, sushi, fresh food prepared for you (though lines do tend to get long at peak hours, say 12:00-12:30), and it's organically sourced. The staff is friendly enough and they're accommodating of your needs and requests. It doesn't get much better than that for a ""cafeteria""."
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"I come here once a week and primarily stick to burritos and well cooked food. One time I ordered burger, it was dangerously under-cooked, minute and 30 seconds short of being a rare. Returning the burger and getting a new one is not a pleasant experience when you are on a brief lunch break."
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"Corporate cafe that sells food to the public. Short walk from one of my clients.  Tried for the first time today. Serves breakfast and lunch (which is what I came for).  Good selection, salads, burgers, pizza, mexican and  today, Indian cuisine. I had methi chicken and bhindi.  The chicken was prepared well, good flavor with the right amount of spices. Okra was also good.  Finished it off with some chayna and basmati rice. Reasonably priced - good food. I'd visit again."
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"After the Indian Chef Atul came in, Indian dishes have turned out to be amazing.Keep up the good work"
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"But seriously, why are the salads so expensive compared to everything else? I got whacked for $16 the other day for soup and salad because my salad was heavy on the scale. Eek!"
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"Brick oven (with real fire) to grill flatbreads / la brea baguette sandwiches. I'm in at La Brea. So good -- grilled chicken with pesto, on a crusty warm baguette. "
OY6FzpkyWKBN5xJTFB00Ww,"I come here all the time for lunch on workdays and this place is great! There's a different menu everyday and the service is fast even when they're packed. Friendly staff, and the food is almost always good. Great outdoor seating for when the weather is on our side...you can almost forget it's a workday and you feel like you're on vacation, if only for an hour."
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,Nice and tasty food.We had Chole Bathure and they were awesome.
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,I have read good things about this place from fellow yelpers and from friends too. All have mentioned their North Indian food rocks! So I have been wanting to try this since a while. Got a chance to place to go this week and I am glad I did. 
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,"Home-style North Indian cuisine in a small hole-in-the-wall setting is what you'll find at Satkar in Sunnyvale! On our visit for dinner, the place was extremely busy with takeout orders--even though we were seated quickly, the food took quite a while to come, but man was it worth it! The dishes here were not only beautifully-plated, but also absolutely spot-on in terms of flavor. The family-run service was extremely friendly and attentive, and the value was unbelievable, making this a great restaurant all around!"
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,The only down side is this place is quite small and offers indoor seating. So ordering take out usually comes with a wait....but if you're in the mood for some good Indian food then the wait is kinda worth it!!
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,A small joint in a small strip mall.  Authentic type of home cooking Indian food. Service was great. Food was the bomb and cheap too. I am putting this in my monthly rotation.
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,One of the best places for North India food in entire bay area. It's a very small place /hole in wall but the food is amazing and always worth a visit.
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,"I was originally going to give this a 4 star review, but I think the naans were too inconsistent to give it a 4 stars. I had ordered for takeout, and got garlic naan, plain naan, onion naan, and baingan bharta. The curry was good, but a little bit on the oily side. However, some naans were fluffy and good while some of them the centers were just thin and hard like a cracker, which I don't think is a characteristic for good naan. "
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,"They are using artificial coloring for food - for samosa chutney for example. Why any place would do it at all? To cover bad quality ingredients? Their orders are not precise, even though I super clear about the dish and asked not to use ANY spices at all."
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,"Simply Bar None in deliciousness!!!   Get chicken kadhai, shahi paneer, onion & garlic naan, and start off w. veg pakora!  Punjabi home cooking at its best...maybe the best Punjabi restaurant in the South Bay!"
r-RImBlPkvHT6CkJUiiBjQ,"Not impressed from what I heard about Karahi paneer. Coming from New jersey where there is abundance of good indian food, I was surprised how the recipe differed so much and did-not have the right ingredients. Of-course the wait time was another killer. We had ordered early enough for take out and we still waited for 20-30 min with 2 toddlers to get our food ready. It might b a great place for non- vegetarians but I m not going back."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"Local, family run restaurant. The food here is homemade & incredible. Very simple decor but delicious food & pretty fast service."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"We ordered for the first time from Siam Fine Thai restaurant in Palo Alto. I typically do not post but came away extremely disappointed by the quality of food, service and portions in our takeout order. I am sharing my thoughts in the hope that this situation can improve for others."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,t was my first time here at the restaurant and usually i'm not a review person but this place is SOOOOO GOOD!! I asked the lady to recommend us the dishes since it was our first time here and what we ordered came out just perfect!! :D 
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"You really cant go wrong, everything I've tried has always been really good. The thai tea tastes like a thai tea should taste. The food tastes like it was made with love and the portions are a good size.  Even the leftovers I took home and had for lunch the next day were amazing. So if you get a chance I highly recommend stopping by this quaint little spot."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,Worst service and rude behavior as they tried to kick us out as they were closing after extremely delayed service. Our friend rice came in the last after 45 mins of the dish that arrived prior.
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"Health inspector needed here. Honestly can't eat here again, these three things probably mean the kitchen isn't a model of cleanliness, either."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"Today I warmed it up and halfway through eating, noticed a fly or other bug of some sort that had clearly been in the soup all along. Absolutely disgusted!!"
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"Was so happy that this Thai restaurant moved near my work. Parking is quite hard in the lot, so better off to park on the street or another parking lot."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"I FOUND SIAM FINE THAI!!! I still remember when they had their San Jose Valley Fair restaurant and it was so small, quaint, yet delicious :) I missed them and was pleasantly surprised to find the same owner/restaurant near my workplace."
JA_V9TqDCrkgknqrcUndIQ,"The lady server keeps on chatting at backside, neglecting guests and very slow in service. The air conditioner did not work. "
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,The experience has deteriorated over the years. The quantity of food has gone down while the prices have gone up.
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,Nice contemporary Thai food. Not traditional bit taste good. 
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,"My friend and I met up on University Avenue to grab lunch, and both of us were craving Asian food. We were debating between Arroy and Siam, and after reading some Yelp reviews, we decided on Arroy. The interior of the restaurant looks very modern and clean. Service was a bit slow, considering the restaurant wasn't busy, but luckily we weren't in a rush."
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,Tom yum veggie soup and yellow curry were what we ordered. Both were yummy especially the soup which was hot and tangy. Loved the ambience and the quick service too.
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,Love the open space with no doors. Gives it a brighter feel. Great for happy hour and groups. I loved the quail but I feel the sauce should be different. It was like a sweet and sour out of the bottle sauce.
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,"Great thai food on University Ave. The roti with 3 curry sauces was a great appetizer to start, the curry sauces were very flavorful. I also had the garlic noodles as my entree which were delicious."
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,Ambiance was nice. Service was good and food was good too. I liked the roti and three curry sauce.
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,Our favorite Thai restaurant! The food is great every time. We alway have a good time and it's in a cool part of Downtown Palo Alto. We recommend this place to every one.
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,"horrible service and mediocre Thai food. Ordered food for pickup here and I don't think I've ever been more humiliated in my life. The guy in charge, Robert, started yelling at me in front of the customers as I was trying to take the food I paid for already. This man not only didn't have the decency to explain the process for pick up order instead SCREAMED at a paying customer. Only to find out that it was the wrong dish. Are you freaking kidding me?? Threw away the entire dish, waste of money. Will never dine here again. Thank you, Robert, for your disgusting customer service and simple request to fulfill a customer's order."
sI08Rv0G1L7ak2rgVDjCMQ,bad service!! The first time we went as a group with co workers birthday celebration. My co worker order was delayed because they said it took awhile to cook but then we know they forgot. 
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw, had green curry and spicy eggplant today. Both of them were really good. I will go back to this restaurant again. 
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,"Shana was not as popular as I expect it to be. Being two blocks away from Downtown Mountain View, it does not seem to be able to attract customers. I got a chance to visit and was satisfied with the dining experience."
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,"In the Mountain View area, this is the place to go. However, I think there are better places in the Bay Area that I still have to explore also, but overall you can't go wrong with this place."
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,This is a great place to have Thai food and I would certainly go back.
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,"Tried this place twice now. Their pineapple fried rice was good but their Thai ice tea is the winner. Their air conditioning is messed up, I hope they fix it soon."
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,"oday though when I went there at 2:25 I was told they had closed their kitchen (their schedule is they close for lunch at 2:30). Their ""Open"" Sign was still lit and there was another customer eating there who looked like his rice was just made. I'll take off only 2 stars for the service and lack of following their own laid out schedule."
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,"Overall, i just come here cause this place is super close to my work, but I think I prefer Amarin Thai if i HAD to eat thai at mtn view cause honestly all the thai spots are whatevers here. The menu options arent unique/extensive enough to keep me coming back and its just too expensive for the portions."
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,Good food with decent quantity but service is not good as well as place is too crowded and loud. Reservations are important for lunch otherwise this place gets very busy. Went with a big group. All of your food came at different times which make it very ackward. We tried roti pratha  and spring rolls- both were yummy and decent size portion. I got chicken shrimp salad which was meat heavy with a few pieces of lettuce. Overall salad taste was good. Will probably do a take out next time.
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,"Have been to this place for lunches a few times, primarily because it is close to my work. Good food in general, especially noodles. My Thai colleagues says that food at this place is pretty authentic."
ooEPu3TtdSaM-vAC0LAPaw,Food was decent but service is terrible. Place was empty but most servers were busy chatting with each other than serving ppl. Had to ask for same things multiple times before it was served. Would think twice before going again. 
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,Close to ridiculously pricey...but this is the bayarea. Close to ridiculously pricey...but this is the bayarea. 
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,Not really worth the wait or the noise. It does get very noisy in the dining area.
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,Overall it was a disappointing experience.
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,So disappointed.
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,"Love this place!  Good service, good food and close to so much shopping!  I highly recommend this place if you're into delicious Thai food."
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,"Bad food, extremely bad service, rude servers. They threatened to charge us for a dish that was not good."
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,"Bad food, extremely bad service, rude servers. They threatened to charge us for a dish that was not good. The food isn't flavorful and the waiters are really really rude (i cannot emphasise this enough). They also refuse to take feedback or criticism and instead insult the customers."
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,"The food is not even that good and the service makes it horrible. The only delicious thing there is the coconut ice cream dessert ... that is bomb! But, not enough to ever make me go back."
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,"Very rude staff too, when we called to enquire why the portion was so little, they just said order someplace else then! Unbelievable! Never ordering or going back again!"
E7CO1S-98fKt7IKS4NTZjg,"Not bad. Went here for a team lunch. They were prompt to seat us down, paid full attention to what we wanted making double sure of special preferences, brought food on time, and refilled"
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"Came for lunch on a Sunday and the restaurant was really crowded. The service was a bit slow and less attentive perhaps because of how busy it was, but otherwise the food was decent though not too memorable. "
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"I was surprised to see the three star reviews because I have had nothing but positive experiences coming here. On my last visit, I finally realized why this place has so few stars. This negative review is based on their dishonest tipping practices. I am writing this so other patrons can watch out. "
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"I really like this place!  The food is good, prices are reasonable, and location is great.  We love coming here for a Thai food fix in a slightly more formal setting.  It's still casual - but it's not a primarily takeout restaurant (like some Thai food places are)."
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"I thought this Thai restaurant was a good one! I did enjoy their chicken pad sew ew with medium spice. Their portions were enough and tasted delicious. The one thing I really did enjoy was their squat ground seats. Too bad these were all reserved but next time, I'll be coming back for those seats and another hardy meal. I didn't like how their tap water had stuff floating in it; just have to order a real beverage next time."
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"Amarin is a solid dinner option on Castro Street that usually pleases everyone, making it a great place to go with a group of friends."
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"Cute restaurant on a busy street in downtown Mountain View! Street parking was challenge! We ate here before a show at shoreline amphitheater. Honestly pretty bummed!! I love Thai food so I'd say I can recognize key flavors in certain dishes. My mom ordered the papaya salad which didn't consist of dried (or hydrated!) shrimp, or any fish sauce! Also no lime juice or chili spice. I ordered the duck curry which also lacked any spice. They had really good costumer  service though; our sodas never reached a bottom. The soda just tasted like water and syrup. The whole experience was underwhelming and overpriced."
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"Finally got to try this place after being shooed away 15min before their closing time once. I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone for two reasons - food and service.  I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone for two reasons - food and service. The waitresses were all in a hurry to get our orders, get our checks paid and drive us out. Find other Thai places to go to, there are a couple around!"
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"Food is good for veg and non-veg both. Now the service part. It was really weird. We were greeted and seated. When the waitress arrived to take our order, thats where it started getting weird. We just ordered appetizers since we were not sure if we will order an entree. The waitress decided to take away our bigger plates and we had to inform her that we might end up ordering our entrees. She gave us a weird look on this and we weren't sure if she understood what we said. She did leave the bigger plates and didn't bother us for rest of the evening. Because of the service, we might get a togo in future."
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"This place is great! I've been here a few times and I always remember it. The complimentary soup is so good during lunch. Very light, clean, and refreshing I ordered the red curry with rice. My friends ordered the green curry and the pad Thai. All were satisfied. Would recommend."
33RrbAgCYY-TPA44wkZaSg,"I have gone there during lunch times and liked the place every single time. The service is pretty good. Ambience ok, and this is not the best flavored Thai food but pretty decent. I love their fresh young coconut beverage."
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,Great place for lunch without breaking your wallet! The portions are huge and so reasonably priced. Lots of options for lunch and dinner. Their dinner service is much different than their lunch special. 
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,Pretty good food. I've been here once or twice and I've enjoyed it. Very spicy isn't too bad so if you like spice I'd go for that.
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,"I was a little underwhelmed with the food here, especially with all the great reviews."
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,I didn't know about this place until my friend insisted on eating eating here. We've been here twice but I don't know what happens to all the pics I had. This Thai restaurant is very small with a decent variety on the menu. 
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,"The service here is friendly, I felt welcomed even though I arrived just a few minutes before closing!"
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,"A large group of about 10 of us arrived at Thai Spoons for a late lunch after a hike. During and even after placing orders, the server convinced us all to get the brown rice instead of white rice, as their brown rice is not just the typical brown rice but a wild rice mix. I ordered a yellow curry with beef. I liked the assortment of vegetables and think that the dish would actually be better vegetarian, as the meat seemed out of place as an add-on and not cooked to be very tender; perhaps it was stir-fried beforehand and simply dropped in before serving. All in all, I've had better curries elsewhere; perhaps the fried rice and noodle dishes hold more promise here, though I usually never order the former. Thai Spoons seems like a family run establishment though and the service is very friendly."
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,Had a double date here for lunch. My boyfriend and I both ordered drunken noodles and it was good. We had hot for level of spiciness and it was pretty spicy. I'll probably order one level lower next time. The flavor was good but not impressive.
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,"This place is amazing! They have a great lunch deal, but I opted for a pad see ew. I asked how spicy is medium spicy and the waitress said ""it's got a kick to it."" She wasn't lying.... it hurt me, but it was delicious. I also tried the garlic fried rice which was amazing and not overpoweringly garlicky. The servers were very sweet. Support this mom and pop shop!"
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,"Very disappointed in my take-out order today. Mostly flavorless dishes. The curiously identical ratio of ingredients in each dish just shows the kitchen is mailing it in. Yes, I know, it's cheap, but at least TRY to make something that reflects the name of the dish!!  "
PTF-8dVoWs0M3JG8GCPnew,Loved their Panang curry. Was there for a Sunday lunch with some friends. Service was good and prompt
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"Awesome food - vey similar to the original food in Thailand. The ambiance and the service can definitely be improved, but from a good perspective - truly awesome, especially the seared scallops and the pumpkin curry"
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"This food isn't amazing, it's good. They happen to be convenient which is why I go. However, DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TO-GO ORDERS!! They get it wrong about 50% of the time. If you can't handle spicy food, this is horrible news for you. Especially if you live far away. #ruineddinners"

XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"Not very impressive (2.5 stars).  I've tried the pad thai, pad see ew, and green curry. The portions are pretty good, but the food is just average. The pad thai  is a little too sweet for me. If you like spicy, I recommend ordering the Thai spicy because otherwise, there's not much spice at all."
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"I got the Pad Thai and it was honestly disgusting. It didn't have any peanut flavor, had way too much lime, and the chicken was chewy and dry. This was nothing like authentic Thai food; I couldn't even eat it. I also got the Chicken Satay, which was bright orange and the peanut sauce had a plastic flavor. Barely edible, but light years better than the Pad Thai. Do not recommend."
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"Haven't eaten much Thai in the work area, and had heard lots of great things about this little spot. Service is painfully slow, and you have to remind the staff over and over again for things.  Coworker's pad thai wasn't very good, the noodles were really slimy and chewy. Not a good consistency. Overall, really good food, but service isn't great."
,
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,Hair in my food. Thanks lotus Thai bistro. I wonder what their health score is...they obviously don't wear hair nets.
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"Ordered through doordash for a work meeting and they didn't provide the sides (salad/soup) that usually comes with the entree. They also forgot to provide a drink that a colleague had ordered. Food was mediocre, portions were quite huge though. I don't think I will give this place another try."
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"Small place but with fantastic food.  The Tom Kha soup is particularly good, chicken satay, or any of the curries."
XRraGM0fw-nMLA5rtqfD5Q,"Not bad,  not the best Thai I have had.  Service was good, beer was cold, but so was the food.  Taste of the Shrimp Pad Thi was good, crab cakes were dry, salad was tasty."
