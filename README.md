# SAFIYA - VADERSentiment---Project
sentiment analysis on restaurants using user reviews

My Webapp is called SAFIYA - Sentiment Analysis for Food in your Area.

SAFIYA is a restaurant search service WebApp that gives a sentiment score for restaurants. 
It uses NLP in backend to process reviews given by users and assigns a sentiment score to their review. 
Using this service, a user can skip the tedious traditional way of reading multiple reviews before selecting a restaurant. 
The service aggregates review data into a single scoring system and takes into account the "social media" lingo as well. 
The WebApp uses YELP API to get restaurant data and Google Maps API to give user the ability to locate a restaurant. 
It generates  Word cloud (D3.js),  for each restaurant to provide clear representation of user sentiments. 
User can also explore interactive mode of VADER score generation for their reviews.

In addition to downloading libraries mentioned in requirements.txt, also download 'punkt' from NLTK.
